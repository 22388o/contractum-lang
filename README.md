# Contractum: RGB contract definition language

Repository is a prototyping for possible RGB contract language, which should
compile to RGB Schema data with additional validation code running on virtual
machine(s) supported by RGB (currently this will be AluVM)

For a sample code pls check [RGB20 fungible token](./RGB20.con)
contract, which should compile into RGB20 Schema
